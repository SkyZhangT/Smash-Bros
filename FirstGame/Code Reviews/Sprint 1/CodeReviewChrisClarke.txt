Name of the reviewed file: CommandMap.cs
Author of the reviewed  cs file: Michael Morrill

Quality of Code: The code is very well written and organized, splitting into appropriate regions. As this class creates and holds the mapping for all control commands,
				most of this file is used for creating and mapping commands to actions. Naming of variables is a little mixed as all class
				variables except for game are capitalized. There is also a variable called HiddenBox and another called HiddenBrick, which
				doesn't help distinguish what these objects are or what the difference is, as well as having names very similar to each other. The
				only thing "missing" is some functionality for the gamepad, which is not required but might be nice to have. There is no gamePad 
				command for quitting or cheat codes.

A hypothetical change: Mapping different or same commands to different keys. With this class, doing this would be very easy as all it would take
						is changing the key or command value.
