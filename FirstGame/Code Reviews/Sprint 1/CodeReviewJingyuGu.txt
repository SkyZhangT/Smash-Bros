This class changes small mario to other types of mario. It has high cohesion because it only does one job.
Names all follow the conventions. But there are some points to be improved(see hypothetical change).

Time used for this code review: 15 minutes.

Hypothetical changes
1. In the line: Avatar.Position = new Vector2(Avatar.Position.X, Avatar.Position.Y + 16);
I think we dont need "+16" to make the entity on the same horizon because we can add gravity and colision detection in Spirnt2.
The gravity makes the mario still standing on ground while changing the power up state.
2. Since the class has Avator with field. It's unnecessary to have return value in each method.
We can just modify the value in Avator. In this way, when changing small mario to small mario, there's nothing needed to be written into the method.
