Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes
A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

The changing of the entity's position could be made to be independent of the entity.
For example, the broken brick moving down could be put into a separate class that could be switched out withing the entity.
This would be somewhat difficult to implement, as there are many entity classes that would need to be updated.
