Overall it is a quality code. All the functions are constructed clearly with one or two lines, which makes the 
code eazy to maintain. Its also a good idea to initiallize the first state as Idel state. Good naming convention
for all variables.

However, there are multiple spots that "this.property" can be change to only "property". 

Time used for this code review: 30 minutes. Its really hard to figure out the relationship between this class
and the states.

Also, there are something that we can fix in future:
	NeedFlip is a property of entity, we should not need to pass it to sprite.
	First sprite should be initialized within the state.
	We might want to explicitly initialize the power state.
