Comments: Code does everything it is supposed to do, but seems to be needlessly complex. It accepts a csv file made from an excel file, so entries are separated by 
		  comma and each consist of the format entity/xcoordinate/ycoordinate.It would be more effective to add for loops to loop through the commas for position to make
		  file easier to work with when level design needs to change. It also consists of two methods, one that finds all entities to add, and another that adds them. It
		  would make more sense and save a little time and memory if these methods were combined.

Hypothetical Change: Changing level design to longer and changing positions. This could support the change, but it would be easier to support if suggested changes above were
implemented.
