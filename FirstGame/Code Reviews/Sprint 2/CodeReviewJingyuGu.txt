This class changes Goomba's state after being hit from top by Mario. A response method clearly shows the collision on screen.
It has functional cohesion since it only change Goomba's state. 


Time used for this code review: 15 minutes.

Hypothetical changes
The "enemy" in constrctor means Mario? The naming is confusing.
Also distinguish blocks and Mario to support block collision with Goomba
