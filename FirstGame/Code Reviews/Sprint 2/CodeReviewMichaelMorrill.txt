Date of code review: 2/26/2019
Sprint number: 2
Name of .cs file being reviewed: IEntity.cs
Author of .cs file being reviewed: (Most recent) Yunhao Zhang, Chris Clarke

Specific comments on code quality: 
- IEntity should be as general as possible
- Multiple variables for specific implementations seems dirty

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 30 minutes
A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

The ActionState variable made me realize that specific state variables don't really belong in the IEntity class.
Since the IEntity class is being used by enemies now, we have separate state variables for Mario and Goombas/Koopas.
It seems that the collision classes rely on this structure, which would make this class difficult to refactor. If
the class were to be refactored, we could pull the enemy-related variables into a separate class, with states and
variables specific to any type of enemy.
