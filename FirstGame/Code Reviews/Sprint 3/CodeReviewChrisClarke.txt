Sprint number: 3
Name of .cs file being reviewed: MarioAvatar.cs
Author of .cs file being reviewed: Everyone

Specific comments on code quality: 
- Too many variables, we should try to condense where we can
- So many if statements for movement in update, could probably condense
- Avatar able to change state inside update, which it shouldn't, but says in comments fixes a bug

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes
A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

Adding additional movement features such as double jumps or speed up movements would be more difficult because of how many if statements to work around, and variables to work around.
Most of this is needed though, so the written code could support the change, it would just take more work than necessary. 
Mostly this class needs refactoring and condensing to lessen confusion.
