Some team members change the class by using delegate. But I think it's reduncdent to use both delegate and gametime.
If it's changed to delegate pattern, why still keeping the gametime to wait for insurction.

According to code smell, it's a large class with many methods. If the methods with gametime can be combined with delegate, the
class can be not so large.


Time used for this code review: 10 minutes.

Hypothetical changes
combine methods. either eliminate elegate or gametime.
