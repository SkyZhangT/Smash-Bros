Sprint number: 3
Name of .cs file being reviewed: AvatarCollision.cs
Author of .cs file being reviewed (most recent): Chris Clarke

Specific comments on code quality: 
- Code is generally easy to follow
- Lots of duplicate code
- Could it be possible to delegate property changes to another class?

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes
A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

There is a large amount of duplicate code in this file. For example, when the avatar hits a coin,
all 4 directions have the same check for a coin entity, and then modify that entity themselves.

Instead of checking what entity was hit for every single possible entity, it could be possible to
add methods to the entity classes that handle collisions. So we could have entityHit.collideRight(Avatar) instead of
checking all cases.

This would be a large change, and does not have many functional implications; however, it would greatly
improve code readability and control flow.
