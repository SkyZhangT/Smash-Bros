Code Quality: Good
-Good Design Patern Implementation
-Good Encapsulation
-Great Cohesion
-Fine Coupling
-Lack of Comments
-Hard to do maintainance and update

Time to Complete the code review: 25 min

Several ways to improve maintainability:
-Add comments
-Add spaces separate irrelevent lines in one long function

just like the avatar collision, we can implement singleton design patern for this class. Although it can
make the code looks better and easier to call the functions inside enemy collision, but we need to revise 
the whole class to implement it. We might left it there and revise it until we really need to do so.

It is confusing that the functions inside this class is designed like a Matryoshka. They call each other 
and formed multiple layer. I believe it will be more clear and eazy to read. Also it saves time between updates.

Overall it is a quality code. All the methods are constructed clearly with less than 15 lines, which makes the 
code eazy to maintain. Its also a good idea to initiallize the first state as Idel state. Good naming convention
for all variables. But more comments around will be even better.
