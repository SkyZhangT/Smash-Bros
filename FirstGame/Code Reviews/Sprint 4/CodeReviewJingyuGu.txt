This class draws the final scores and score pannel during the game.
In Draw method, those lines of DrawString can be simplied by using string builder in the other two methods.
This needs refactoring

Using a string to convert score to 6 digit is copied many times in this class.
So this part can be made into one helper method.

World="1-1" should be read from level, and add world name into level file


Time used for this code review: 10 minutes.

Hypothetical changes
using string builder, make a new method, read world name from level
