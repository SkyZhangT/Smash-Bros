A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

With the addition of cutscenes, Game1 has become dirty. There are many global variables that make it difficult to understand
everything that Game1 is doing. Some script files have been started, and we could do more to make cutscenes work independent of Game1.
Some difficulty in this would be trying to define the relationship between the game's state and these scripts, and how to make these 2 elements
work without being dependent on each other.
