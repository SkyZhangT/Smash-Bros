-nice clear methods
-not a lot global variables
-good encapsulation of variables

The prospect memory is just a class with a public float, I am not really
understand why we need this. Can't we just use a float?

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes

If this class is managing the game state transition like its name, why it 
is dealing with sounds and checkpoints. It should focus on the transition '
from game to end-game scene, or from the place mario dead to the last 
checkpoint.

Overall it is a quality code. All the methods are constructed clearly with less than 15 lines, which makes the 
code eazy to maintain. Its also a good idea to initiallize the first state as Idel state. Good naming convention
for all variables. But more comments around will be even better.
