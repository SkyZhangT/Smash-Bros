Why font is loaded in update()? Should that be in initialize()?
The 3 big if branches and 6 small if branches in draw contain many duplicated code.
Other strings can be drawn by using string builder.
I think scene functions the same as GameSate, so I don't know they should be 2 interfaces.


Time used for this code review: 10 minutes.

Hypothetical changes
The big if branches can be simplified as 
declear AvatarList1 contains 2 Mario with different color
AvatarList2 AvatarList3 to contain other avatars with 2 colors.
if one key is pressed, pop one of three AvatarList to get the avatar.
Don't need too many if branches.
