Sprint number: 5

Specific comments on code quality: 
- Redundant variables
- Could be refactored so that some features are in other classes

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 20 minutes
A hypothetical change to make the game related to file being reviewed and
how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

With power ups, it does not make structural sense to put the actual power-up execution in the AvatarMain class. Power ups could each have their own class,
with each containing the specific logic for each power up. The code for the power ups is well-written, and could easily be put into multiple classes without significant
modification.

There are also 4 different state variables in the class, CurrentState, CurrentActionState, CurrentPowerState, and ActionState. This could be reduced to 2 for
simplification, but the amount of references to each variable might make this difficult.
