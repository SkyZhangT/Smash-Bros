Sprint number: 5
Name of .cs file being reviewed: Level.cs
Author of .cs file being reviewed (most recent): Jingyu Gu

Several first impressions:
-No comments
-Long methods
-Huge switch

There are no comments at all, I need to look through all the relative class to know the purpose of
the lines. Add comments can help with later maintainance.

It is a class that reads the csv level file and generates entities based on the file content.
In sprint 5, some of the entities are no-longer in use, so it will be cleaner if we comment them
out. 

It is well capsulated because all the variables are hidding in the abstract class. However, the 
variables with internal keys are better implemented as private variables inside the class. 

Two lists: ItemBlockList and Floorlists are supposed to be the same list, because floors is a special
type of block. However, the type of itemblocklist is IEntity while the Floorlist is IBlockEntity.
It is supposed to be consistant because they all implements IEntity interface.

The class already takes Game as a parameter, why it needs the entitymanager? EntityManager is a object
contained by Game and it is public, we should able to directly use Game.EntityManager to access it.
